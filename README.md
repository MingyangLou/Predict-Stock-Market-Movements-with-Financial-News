# Predict-Stock-Market-Movements-with-Financial-News
>A data science/ machine learning project that utilizes financial news data from 2006 to 2013 to predict S&P 500 index directional movements within the same time span.

>[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G42dY5b8jg0) is a brief introductory vedio for this project.

## Motivations
### Financial News & Market Response
Financial news is a critical resource to influence market movements.
- Macroeconomic News (Country Level)
  * GDP
  * Currency
- Microeconomic News (Company Level)
  * M&A
  * Expected & real revenues

Investors do make decisions on next steps depending on the news. Moreover, this response is highly time sensitive.
### Predict Market Movements with Financial News
Our biggest motivation is to __benefit individuals without financial backgrounds in investments__. Financial news usually come with a considerable amount of jargon, which makes it inaccessible to a lot of investors, and we aspire to break this barrier.
## Data
### Data Collection
The __news data__ consists of more than 100,000 financial news articles from Reuter's website within the time span from 2006 to 2013. This dataset was compiled and first used in [Ding et al. (2014)](http://emnlp2014.org/papers/pdf/EMNLP2014148.pdf).

The __S&P 500__ index data was downloaded from the Yahoo Finance.

### Data Processing
