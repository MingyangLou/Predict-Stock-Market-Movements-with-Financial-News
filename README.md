## Motivations
### Financial News & Market Response
Financial news is a critical resource to influence market movements.
- Macroeconomic News (Country Level)
  * GDP
  * Currency
- Microeconomic News (Company Level)
  * M&A
  * Expected & real revenues

Investors do make decisions on next steps depending on the news. Moreover, this response is highly time sensitive.
### Predict Market Movements with Financial News
Our biggest motivation is to __benefit individuals without financial backgrounds in investments__. Financial news usually come with a considerable amount of lingo, which makes it inaccessible to a lot of investors, and we aspire to break this barrier.
